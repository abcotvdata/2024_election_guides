        <p>Voters in Marin County will cast their ballots in a number of important races this November including for county supervisor and San Rafael mayor.</p>

        <p>To register to vote in California, you must be a United States citizen and a resident of California, 18 years old or older on Election Day, not currently serving a state or federal prison term for the conviction of a felony, and not currently found mentally incompetent to vote by a court.</p>

        <p id="Deadlines">To find out if you are currently registered to vote, you can visit the state's <a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov" target="_blank">My Voter Status site</a> and if you're not, you can <a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/" target="_blank">register online</a> up to 15 days before the election. However, if you miss the deadline, you can still cast a conditional ballot in-person at your county elections office, polling place, or vote center.</p>

                  <p>All California active registered voters will receive a vote-by-mail ballot for the November 5, 2024, General Election. County elections began mailing ballots on October 7, and ballot drop-off boxes open on October 8. Vote-by-mail ballots can be returned by mail, at a drop-off location, or at your county elections office.</p>

                  <p>The last day to register to vote for this election is October 21, however, California does offer "Same Day Voter Registration," also known as conditional registration. Eligible citizens can register and then vote at their county elections office, polling place, or vote center. Their ballots will be processed and counted once the county elections office has completed the voter registration verification process.</p>
            
                  <p>A limited number of Vote Centers open for early in-person voting in all Voter’s Choice Act counties beginning on Saturday, October 26, with all opening on Saturday, November 2.</p>
